Issue-1: 

Summary: I ran terraform apply to create a project aishift-prd.  It created the project but could not link 
billing account to it because quota has expired.

Solution: 
1. I disabled the billing for another project merge-with-ai and tried to run terraform apply
Now, it said that it is tainted and needs to be destroyed and replaced as shown below: 

google_project.create_gcp_project: Refreshing state... [id=projects/aishift-prd]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following    
symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_project.create_gcp_project is tainted, so must be replaced

2. Now, I untainted it to tell terraform that it is ok, it is already there, leave it. 

C:\pk\infra-repo\terraform\env\prd>terraform untaint google_project.create_gcp_project
Resource instance google_project.create_gcp_project has been successfully untainted.

3. After untaint, i ran apply again and now it worked successfully
output: 
google_project.create_gcp_project: Modifying... [id=projects/aishift-prd]
google_project.create_gcp_project: Modifications complete after 3s [id=projects/aishift-prd]

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
